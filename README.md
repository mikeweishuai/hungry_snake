# hungry_snake
A simple snake game.
Though the "snake" looks more like a worm and eats apples.
Currently I put all my external images in the mipmap respository for convienence, will fix that at some time in the future...

Current capabilities:
  * simple snake game with score
  * single difficulty
  * able to restart after gameover
   * display score on the gameover page
  * Player can select difficulties at the beginning
  
Future capabilities:
  * Score rank
  * etc

A snake game.
Though the "snake" looks more like a worm and eats apples.

### Gameplay Features
>This is a snake game with some new features. You can view your score at the up left corner. There are three difficulties for the game: easy, medium, and hard.
>* For 'easy' mode, this game acts just like any other simple snake game: A snake, and an apple. The snake will grow longer each time it swallows an apple. And it will die if it hit the boundary or eat itself.
>* For 'medium' mode, the snake moves much faster. And there will be a wall that randomly locates in the map. Don't hit the wall!
>* For 'hard' mode, things become much harder. The snake will move slightly faster and there will be a cloud: You cannot see the snake when the snake is under a cloud. However, you still able to see the apple and the wall above the cloud (though make nosense in real life...).

### Graphic Features
>The snake is not filled with pure color with a shape of rectangle, instead, We made some art resource by myself for it (including snake itself, cloud, background, title). 
The head of snake can change its orientation everytime the player change the direction.

### Reference
>The development of SnakeEngine is based on this [Tutorial](http://gamecodeschool.com/android/coding-a-snake-game-for-android/).

Current issues:
  * Currently I put all my external images in the mipmap respository for convienence, will fix that at some time in the future...
  * Sometimes the apple spawns inside of the wall or snakeboby.
  * Sometimes the wall will spawn just ahead of the snake, which causes player die in one second.
  
Future capabilities:
  * Score rank
  * UI
  * etc
